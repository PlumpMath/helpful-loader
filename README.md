# helpful-loader

A Clojure library to load resources with helpful error messages.

## Install

Add `[helpful-loader "0.1.1"]` to `:dependencies` in your `project.clj`.

## Usage

Load one form worth of edn content from a file on the classpath:

```clj
(ns example
  (:require [helpful-loader.edn :as edn-loader]))

(edn-loader/load-one "my-config.edn")
```

So, with `resources` on the class path, this would pick up
`resources/my-config.edn` and load the edn form contained within.

It works pretty much like this:

```clj
(clojure.edn/read-string (slurp (clojure.java.io/resource "my-config.edn")))
```

### So, how is this better than just doing it myself?

Three reasons:

- If the file doesn't exist, you'd normally see this:

  ```
  No implementation of method: :make-reader of protocol:
   #'clojure.java.io/IOFactory found for class: nil
  ```

  With helpful-loader you see:

  ```
  Unable to load my-config.edn, no such file on classpath.
  ```

- If the file is malformed, you'd normally see this:

  ```
  EOF while reading
  ```

  With helpful-loader you see:

  ```
  Error in my-config.edn: EOF while reading
  ```

- If the file has multiple forms, it would normally just be ignored
  by the reader. And you would be left scratching your head wondering
  why your changes didn't show up at all.

  With helpful-loader you see:

  ```
  /my-config.edn should contain only a single form, but had 2 forms.
  ```

## More stuff

```
(edn-loader/load-one-or-nil "my-config.edn")
```

This one will just return `nil` if the file doesn't exist, but will still brook
no nonsense for existing files, like above.
